# Machine-Learning-on-Resale-Flats-Information
#### This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict prices of resale flats based on information such as town, flat type, floor area, etc. The project utilises Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Neural Network, and shows visualizations for each model to demonstrate their respective accuracies.
